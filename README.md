The Website is a sample website built with React, It is fully responsive, and I used Context api to manage the data coming from Contentful.
What is cool and interesting in this project is the filter wich is in the Rooms page where you can really find your perfect room based on type, number of guest,
price,Size etc..
Each room has a personal space with details pictures etc...
